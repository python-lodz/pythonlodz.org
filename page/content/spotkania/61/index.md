### Airflow 3, and the boring, production AI plumbing, that nobody talks about
{{< speaker speaker_id="jarek-potiuk" >}}
Airflow 3 is out. Spring last year the Airflow community came to the conclusion that in order to respond to the growing needs of our users, we have to again reinvent ourselves in the modern AI world.  
  
Airflow 3 is already out for a few months and we already know that we got on the right track - our users are already using Airflow to do with AI what they were doing several years ago for traditional ETL/ ELT workflows - turning experiments and local workflows into stable, production-ready way how to manage your various AI-related needs.  
  
From my talk you will learn:  
  
* why we decided to switch gears for Airflow 3 (yes, AI)  
* what are the architectural changes and improvements that lay foundation under Airflow 3 being modern and applicable to AI workflows  
* what are the features that help with production-ready workflows: Versioning, Enterprise level security isolation, better dependency management, execution isolation, dataset as first class citizen, modern react-based UI, schedulable and UI-controlled backfills, inference kind of workflows, "almost" streaming experience, and more  
* what early users of Airflow 3 say and how their workflow management improved  
* what is coming next (yes! we are not nearly done yet and more things are coming!)

### System init written in Python - project analysis
{{< speaker speaker_id="mateusz-piwek" >}}
Python is used in many areas – such as web development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, and embedded systems. But can it also be used as an init system in Linux, and does that idea make sense?  
  
The init system is the main process that starts and monitors services in the operating system. Traditionally, such systems are developed in the C language to ensure high code efficiency – but perhaps it’s worth reconsidering this approach?  
  
In this presentation, the author will present a working project, show performance test results, and share ideas for unconventional applications.
